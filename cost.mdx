title: "7. Costs to Operate"
description: "The Call-Emma.ai add-on solution for call center software is highly configurable, allowing organizations to tailor operational setups based on their specific needs for cost, performance, and quality. This page explains the trade-offs between these factors to help administrators and business leaders make informed decisions. To illustrate the system's flexibility, we present two example configurations: one optimized for high-speed, high-quality performance, and another designed for slower, cost-efficient operation."

Cost Optimized

For security, all AI LLM processing will be performed on the cloud instance. This configuration is ideal for cost-optimized processing. Note that costs and spot instance pricing are subject to change.
