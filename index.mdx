## AI Generated - Call Details - Use Cases

<Card title="Summary">
  By providing high-quality, comprehensive AI-generated call summaries that minimize the time agents spend reviewing prior notes, callers experience shorter initial hold times and smoother interactions, while the company benefits from reduced overall call durations and the elimination of error-prone handwritten agent notes.
</Card>

<Card title="Satisfaction of the Customer's Objectives ">
  The AI extracts the caller's objectives and then determines whether the agent fulfilled each one. This dramatically improves the supervisor's ability to provide quality control and reduces review time to seconds, compared to the old method of listening to an entire call.
</Card>

<Card title="Agent's Actions">
  The AI extracts all the actions taken by the agent and lists them, making it easy for supervisors to review what occurred, again saving them from having to listen to the call.
</Card>

<Card title="Agent's Post-Call Task List">
  The AI summarizes any tasks the agent mentioned they would complete, reducing post-call note-taking, assisting other agents with follow-up, and enabling task list automation.
</Card>

<Card title="Customer's Post-Call Task List">
  The AI summarizes any tasks the customer agreed to or was advised to complete, reducing agent note-taking and enabling automated follow-up communication on required actions.
