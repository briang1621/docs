## **Security & Compliance Questions**

**What security features are in place?**\
Emma uses FastAPI to serve API responses, leveraging its built-in security features, including SSL encryption and secure access tokens. Authenticated user login is required for both administrator panels. All access is logged to enable comprehensive access auditing.

**Does the software comply with industry standards (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR)?**\
If personal identity information removal is enabled during audio processing, we can demonstrate compliance with relevant industry standards, including SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR, through the certified packages we utilize.

## **Deployment, Integration, & Processing Speed**

**Can the software be hosted on-premises or in a private cloud?**\
Yes, the software supports deployment in on-premises and private cloud environments. Validation has been performed on AWS. Hybrid deployments are not currently supported.

**What APIs or connectors are available for integration with CCS? Is documentation provided?**\
The platform provides RESTful APIs built with FastAPI, featuring self-describing endpoints. Comprehensive API documentation is available through OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) to facilitate seamless integration with CCS.

**What is the expected duration for initial deployment?**\
Initial deployment is streamlined through containerized delivery. However, API integration requires development effort. We recommend allocating a minimum of 20 hours, with most of the time focused on integration testing.

**What are the disk space requirements?**\
Disk space requirements start at approximately 5 GB when using a remote LLM. This requirement increases based on the size of the local LLM downloaded via Ollama.

**What are the minimum and recommended cloud instance specifications?**\
Please refer to our cost and infrastructure documentation for detailed specifications.

## **Scalability & Performance**

**How does the system scale?**\
The system monitors the job queue and dynamically scales resources up or down based on workload demands.

## **Cloud Hosting Support**

**Can the software run on different cloud platforms?**\
Yes. Emma is fully containerized, enabling deployment across a wide range of cloud environments. While we have validated deployments on AWS, the containerized architecture ensures compatibility with other major cloud providers such as Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and private cloud infrastructures. This flexibility allows organizations to deploy Emma within their preferred environment while meeting performance and compliance requirements.

## **Cost & Licensing**

**What are the licensing rates and terms?**\
Licensing is based on an estimated number of users. Please contact us directly for detailed rates and licensing terms.

**What is the cost of the system?**\
We are currently seeking beta customers for pilot deployments. Beta participants are required to make an initial payment, which may be applied toward future licensing costs.

## **Support & SLAs**

**Do you provide support or software upgrades?**\
Support and upgrades are included if specified in the negotiated licensing agreement.

## **Training & Onboarding**

**Is onboarding or training provided?**\
Yes, we offer daily integration support as part of the onboarding process.
