## Beta Access Program

We're currently welcoming select organizations to participate in our **Beta Access Program**. In exchange for early feedback and insights, beta partners will receive:

- **Significant lifetime discounts** on all future licensing costs
- **Early access** to new features and improvements
- **Direct influence** on product roadmap and capabilities
- Follow the same terms of the standard licensing agreement

This is a unique opportunity to shape the future of Emma while securing exceptional long-term value. Space is limited, and we're looking for organizations that are ready to collaborate and innovate alongside us.

### Standard Licensing

For production-ready environments, Emma is available through a simple company-wide licensing model:

- **Compiled deployment**: You will receive a fully compiled version of Emma that can be deployed across your organization.
- **Unlimited internal use**: Use Emma to its full potential within your company for analysis, automation, and strategic outputs.
- **Sell your results**: All licenses permit the resale, distribution, or commercialization of the _results_ produced by Emma (e.g., AI insights and data), giving you full freedom to monetize your work.
- **No resale of Emma itself**: Licenses strictly prohibit the resale, re-licensing, or redistribution of the core Emma software in any form, even if the company is sold to another enty. 

###  Need a Custom License?
